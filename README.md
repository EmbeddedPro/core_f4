Minimal configuration for STM32f407V

This repository is for http://www.wvshare.com/product/Open407V-C-Standard.htm
but can be easily adapted for every STM32f4

It's blinking some LEDs and writes dummy text on UART3.

Prerequisites:

	1. STM32CubeMX code generator - http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF259242
	2. STM32CubeF4 firmware - http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF259243
	3. STM32_CUBE_ROOT eclipse project environment variable to point to STM32CubeF4 folder
	4. Eclipse CDT
	5. GCC

Under the src/generated you will find the files that can be generated/updated by STM32CubeMX utility.
In this particular case, it is configured for the maximum frequency (168 MHz), UART 3 enabled and can be used as debug uart.

All you need is to modify src/generated/STM32f4407VET.ioc and regenerate.

All the files are copyrighted to ST.
The linker file is generated by STM32CubeMX for Atollic, but it works as well with eclipse / GCC.
